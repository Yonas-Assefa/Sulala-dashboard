# Sulala Development Guidelines

> Welcome to Sulala! This document outlines the guidelines and expectations for development work on the project.

## Git Workflow

This project follows the trunk-based Git branching strategy. When creating a new branch, please adhere to the following naming convention:

- `feat/`: Used for adding new features or enhancements.
- `fix/`: Used for bug fixes.
- `docs/`: Used for documentation-related changes.
- `hotfix/`: Used for critical bug fixes that require immediate attention.
- `integrate/`: Used for branch integration or merging purposes.
  Following this naming convention helps maintain consistency and clarity in branch identification.

Please note that branches should be created based on the specific task or feature being worked on to ensure efficient collaboration and code management.

Remember to regularly sync your branch with the main/trunk branch to incorporate the latest changes and minimize conflicts during the merge process.

If you have any questions or need further clarification on the Git workflow, please reach out to the project maintainers.

## Coding Style and Standards

This project follows specific code formatting and styling guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability. The following tools are used for code formatting and styling:

- `ESLint`: The project utilizes ESLint, a widely adopted JavaScript linter, to enforce coding standards and detect potential issues in the codebase. It helps maintain a clean and error-free codebase by catching common mistakes and enforcing best practices.
- `Prettier`: Prettier is used in conjunction with ESLint to automatically format the code according to predefined rules. It ensures consistent code formatting across the project, minimizing stylistic differences between contributors and improving readability.

To ensure adherence to the coding style and standards, it is recommended to integrate ESLint and Prettier with your preferred code editor. This enables real-time linting and automatic code formatting as you work on the project.

Before committing your changes, make sure to run the appropriate ESLint and Prettier commands to ensure your code meets the project's coding standards. This helps maintain a high level of code quality and consistency throughout the project.

Additionally, it is important to review and follow any specific coding guidelines or conventions established by the project. These guidelines may cover naming conventions, file organization, documentation requirements, and any other relevant coding practices.

If you have any questions or need further clarification on the coding style and standards, please consult the project's documentation or reach out to the project maintainers.
